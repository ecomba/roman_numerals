Roman numerals Kata (RubyQuiz #22)
Author: Enrique Comba Riepenhausen

I present here only an empty (lib/roman_numerals.rb) file where you will have to add your code
as you go.

There is also a spec file (spec/roman_numerals_spec.rb) where you can find a bunch of tests 
that assert that your code is running properly. All but the first example are commented out
(using the xit notation). Don't forget to remove the x infront of the it to activate the
next example.

Have fun!

Enrique
